### Messaging Security Lesson 1 - Wk 8

Eric Peterson ([https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-peterson-b3500256/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-peterson-b3500256/)) is currently Director of Threat Research at McAfee, but at the time of the lectures was simply the Research Manager for Email Security.

Regex Coach [http://weitz.de/regex-coach/](http://weitz.de/regex-coach/) is a cool tool, and I wish I had known about it years ago. Like most people, Iam not a regex ninja, and this tool makes it very clear what the regex catches. The only feature that seems to be missing is treating CRLF as a new string (so you can see which strings you are hitting simultantouesly / multiple strings in the box). It doesn't appear to be open source, and apparently hasn't had an update since 2008, so eventually the program will likely end up dying, sadly.
