Week 2 Lesson 3 - Advanced Forensics 1

Recommended Book:
Cliff Stohl - The Cuckoo's Egg: [https://www.amazon.com/Cuckoos-Egg-Tracking-Computer-Espionage/dp/1416507787](https://www.amazon.com/Cuckoos-Egg-Tracking-Computer-Espionage/dp/1416507787)

Forensic Computing - the process of identifying, preserving, analyzing, and presenting digital evidence in a  manner that is legally acceptable. (McKemmish 1999)

Rules for Computer Forensics:
1. Minimize Data Loss
2. Record EVERYTHING
3. Analyze all data collected (evidence)
4. Report Findings

This is interesting and meshes well with much of the training I received in my Master's program - several courses in that program provided the training basis for forensic investigation of crimes and expert witnessing. It also fits well with various Site Exploitation techniques I learned and used in the Army. While those were related to Psychology and hard evidence respectively, the fundamentals are the same.

"Triage" - prove the same conclusion in different ways.

SIEM - Security, Information, and Events Management system (like [http://www.logalyze.com](http://www.logalyze.com))

Locard's Exchange Principle - when two objects come into contact, there will be evidence of the contact.

Like Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle - you cannot observer and measure the state of the system without changing it.
