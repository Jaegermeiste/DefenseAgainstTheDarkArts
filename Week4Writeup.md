### Software Vulnerabilities and Common Exploits Lesson 1 - Wk 4

Brad Antoniewicz ([@brad_anton](https://twitter.com/brad_anton)) is currently a Security Research Manager at OpenDNS/Cisco, but was R&D Manager at Intel Foundstone and Adjunct Professor at NYU at the time of the video.

[http://cwe.mitre.org/data/index.html](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/index.html) has various filters and views listing common software vulnerabilities for a programmer to worry about. For example, [http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/14.html](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/14.html) is an interesting one - compiler optimizations removing code that clears the contents of a buffer (because the buffer is never accessed again afterwards). Thus you need a secure way to zero a buffer wihtout the compiler optimizing it away - either by manually doing something like:

``` C
memset(buffer, 0, sizeof(buffer)); 
buffer[0] = 0;    // Prevent compiiler optimizing away memset by (meaninglessly) accessing it afterward
```

or in Win32, using SecureZeroMemory ([https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa366877(v=vs.85).aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa366877(v=vs.85).aspx)) instead of ZeroMemory.

### Software Vulnerabilities and Common Exploits Lesson 2 - Wk 4

Random note: `\u4141` used in the exploit examples is ‰ÖÅ, the unified Chinese/Japanese/Korean "Ideograph to husk rice; to get the grains by oppressing the ears of the rice plant" ([https://unicode-table.com/en/4141/](https://unicode-table.com/en/4141/)). Sort of apropos.

Enabling the Low Fragmentation Heap is important in order to ensure there is contiguous memory to exploit. The heap is prdicatably organized, so you can load exploit code in high memory, replace a freed object in the LFH with a pointer to your exploit code, and then the code itself will execute the exploit naturally the next time the compromised object is called.
