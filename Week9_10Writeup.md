### Mobile Security Lesson 1 - Wk 9

Fernando Ruiz 

This is a nice walkthrough through the history of modern mobile devices and the history of malicious attacks against early mobile devices (of which I was mostly completely unaware). The lecture is showing its age more than any other in the course (Windows Mobile still going strong!), but the information is pertinent and despite the apparent age, was highly informative.

In terms of Android architecture, I probably got more out of this lecture than I had from several years of tinkering with Android. The Android developer documentaiton can be through but dense, and as Intents were presented in this elcture, I thought that it might well be the most clear and concise explanation of what they were that I have ever heard.

Having owned an Android phone since the Droid era, I am very familiar with rooting and deodexing, but the mechanisma used to actually acquire root and the structure of an APK were vague to me until this presentaiton (as above). Another strong impression.
